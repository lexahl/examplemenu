# â˜ž what is a QR Code menu?
A QR code menu is a digital menu that's accessible to your restaurant guests via their smartphones after scanning your menu's personalized QR code. Your guests will only have to scan the QR code with their mobile device to access the menu. This can be done as a PDF, where the PDF of your menu is hosted on a secure website and guests access this PDF via the QR Code or URL, or as a website. A website like this example site can be created for your menu with your restaurants style and feel to give customers a better user experience. A website also has the ability to provide you with insights about your customers from the information collected when they access the website.
